# InfiniteRadix
InfiniteRadix can show you the base 10 value of a number written in whatever base, up to base 36.
This code does not use built in base converting functions.

## Method: ##
To start it with your chosen number and base; run the script with two arguments: the first is the base sequence starting from 11 (which means that it starts with the letter a), the second is the number you want to convert.

## Example: ##
```node script.js abcdefgh 1dab1```
